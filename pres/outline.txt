1) DEvAl

  - Deval is an optimization algorithm.
  - Some other optimization algorithms are:
    -> Simulated Annealing
    -> Newton Raphson's
    -> Genetic algorithms

  - Example of an optimzation problem:
    -> Solve for roots and square roots
    -> One could use a closed form algorithm:
      - Newtons, etc.
      But that would be boring.

  - Enter the evolutionary algorithm (to solve sqrt(5)).
    -> Procedure:

    1) Generate a list of possible square roots.
    2) Determine the fitness of each possible solution.
       i.e: how good is the solution? Give an answer numerically
    3) Sort the solutions accorinding to their fitness.
    4) Breed a new generation of solutions by randomly breeding some of the
       better solutions.
    5) Replace bad solutions with the newly bred solutions; rinse, repeat.

2) Metrics for evolutionary algorithms.

  - Generations per second
    -> Naturally arises from the problem: how many generations can we do in a
       second (or conversely, how many seconds per generation).
    -> Brute force approach. Though it measures how many computations we are
       doing in a given time frame, it does not really measure how efective
       those computations are.
  - Convergence
    -> Can be thought of in a few different ways.
      . Average fitness of the population: how long does it take before the
        avg fitness of the population is no longer getting significantly better
	per generation?
      . This requires a way to define "significantly better". This will vary
        from problem to problem.
      . Overall best solution: Once you find at least one solution that is
        good enough, you have converged.
      . Requires a definition for "good enough", again like the avaerage
      	population, this will vary from problem to problem.
    -> We will use average population because it better shows the performance
       of the algorithm. One could get very lucky with the initial guesses and
       find a perfect solution early on, but this is not something to rely on.

3) How does this relate to solving the quare root of 5?
  
  - The square root of 5 is the number that, when multiplied by itself equals
    5. Derr. This leads to the following equation:

    X^2 = 5

  - This can be rewritten as -X^2 + 5 = 0
  - This form of the equation is much more simple to solve: it is a simple root
    finding problem. One could of course use a method like Newton's algorithm
    but that type of algorithm would not scale to many dimensional problems.
  - Fitness function:
    
      abs(-(x*x) + 5)

  - When plotted this shows two dips to 0 (for +/- sqrt(5)). The evolutionary
    algorithm can find these dips in the solution space.
