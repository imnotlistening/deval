## usage: [NN, XX] = histn (Y, X, NORM)  or  hist (Y, X, NORM)
##
## Produce histogram counts or plots.
##
## With one vector input argument, plot a histogram of the values with
## 10 bins.  The range of the histogram bins is determined by the range
## of the data.
##
## Given a second scalar argument, use that as the number of bins.
##
## Given a second vector argument, use that as the centers of the bins,
## with the width of the bins determened from the adjacent values in
## the vector.
## 

## If third argument is provided, the histogram is normalised such that
## the sum of the bars is equal to NORM.
##
## Extreme values are lumped in the first and last bins.
##
## With two output arguments, produce the values NN and XX such that
## bar (XX, NN) will plot the histogram.
